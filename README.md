Project Title: Chatbot

Description:

The Medical Chatbot is a Python-based program designed to provide users with information and guidance on a variety of medical topics. This chatbot leverages regular expressions to match user input with predefined patterns and responds with relevant medical advice and information. It offers assistance on common symptoms, specific medical conditions, and general health inquiries.

Key Features:

User-Friendly Interface: The web application provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface designed using Tkinter, with a custom design that includes a chat log, input field, and a submit button.

Predefined Medical Rules: The chatbot is equipped with predefined rules and responses for common medical queries, including greetings, symptom inquiries, and general health advice.

Real-time Interaction: Users can input their medical questions or symptoms in the provided input field and receive real-time responses from the chatbot, which are displayed in the chat log area.

Customizable Design: The GUI design is customizable, allowing developers to modify the window size, background colors, button styles, and other visual elements to fit specific preferences.

Submit by Enter Key: Users can submit their queries by pressing the Enter key, in addition to clicking the "Submit" button, enhancing the user experience.

Error Handling: If the chatbot doesn't recognize a query, it provides a default message suggesting users ask a different question or consult a healthcare professional.

# Task 2
Project Title: TIC-TAC-TOE

Description:

The above code project is a Python implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe with an unbeatable AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning. The project is built as a graphical user interface (GUI) application using the Tkinter library.

Key Features:

Game Grid: The GUI presents a 3x3 grid representing the Tic-Tac-Toe board, where players can make their moves.

Player Symbol Selection: At the beginning of the game, the player is prompted to choose their symbol between 'X' and 'O' by clicking the "Choose X" or "Choose O" buttons.

AI Opponent: The AI opponent always takes the opposite symbol of what the player chooses. If the player selects 'X,' the AI plays as 'O,' and if the player selects 'O,' the AI plays as 'X.'

Minimax Algorithm: The AI employs the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to make decisions and ensure an unbeatable opponent.

Gameplay: The player and AI take turns making moves by clicking on empty cells in the grid. The AI's move is calculated to maximize its chances of winning or achieving a tie.

Game Over Detection: The code continuously checks for a game-over condition, whether a player wins, the AI wins, or the game ends in a tie.

Result Display: When the game concludes, a message box is displayed to announce the result, indicating the winner or declaring a tie.

Resetting the Game: After each game, the board can be reset for a new round, and the player can select their symbol again.

# Task 3

Project Title: Book Recommendation System

Description:
The application is designed to provide book recommendations to users based on their selected genre preferences.
It uses a real dataset of books, which can be replaced with your own dataset.
Users can choose a genre from a dropdown list, and upon clicking the "Recommend Books" button, the system displays a list of recommended books from the selected genre.
The recommendations are sorted by book ratings, displaying the top-rated books first.
The book titles are clickable links that, when clicked, open the book's URL in the default web browser.
The application has a clean and user-friendly graphical interface created with Tkinter and ttk (themed Tkinter) widgets.
It features a customizable title frame with a distinctive background color and a title label.
The main content is displayed within a frame, which itself is placed inside a canvas to enable scrolling if the content exceeds the available space.

Key Features:
Genre selection via a dropdown list.
Book recommendations based on the selected genre.
Clickable book titles for easy access to book details online.
User-friendly and aesthetically pleasing interface with customizable background colors.

Usage:
Run the application.
Select a genre from the dropdown list.
Click the "Recommend Books" button.
View the list of recommended books with clickable titles.

Note: To use this code with your own dataset, replace the books.csv file with your dataset and adjust the code accordingly.
